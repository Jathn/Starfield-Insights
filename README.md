# ClusterScope ðŸŒŒ

**A hackathon project for Aalto University Space**  
**Mapping Space Data Through Unsupervised Learning and Geographical Visualization**

## Project Overview

ClusterScope is a data-driven exploration project that leverages unsupervised learning to analyze vast datasets of space-related information. Our goal is to uncover hidden patterns and correlations within astronomical data, grouping and visualizing it by geographical locations to present insights that were previously unseen.

Using advanced clustering algorithms, we aim to reveal unique spatial relationships in the cosmos, with applications that could benefit research, education, and the broader space science community.

## Features

- **Clustering Analysis:** Using unsupervised learning to identify and group related data points from a massive space dataset.
- **Geographical Mapping:** Visualizing clusters based on geographical data to create novel perspectives of spatial relationships.
- **Scalable Data Processing:** Designed to handle large datasets and explore the potential of using Big Data tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Required Libraries:** `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `geopandas` (for geographical mapping)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ClusterScope.git
   cd ClusterScope
